This is a console game application, but is not finished yet. 

This game is randomly generating a "battle map" where you need to pass through waves of enemies. The Idea is when you encounter a battle you have different choices and whether you succed or fail is based on your stats and rolls.
The idea behind this project was trying to keep a OOP approach where future changes would not be bottlenecked by bad programming habits, and the gameplaymechanics where not the focus. Therefor I have build everything using inheritence where
I see fit, and composition where it is more viable solution to the problem.
